About US:
S Lab was recently founded at Shenzhen’s Quantum Science Center in the Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao Greater Bay Area (粤港澳大湾区量子科学中心). 
With over six years of collective experience, our founding team is dedicated to realizing the potential of quantum computing. 
By collaborating with academic and industrial partners and using our leading fluxonium technologies, we focus on developing large-scale superconducting quantum processors for "quantum-leaped" artificial intelligence systems and applications. 
We are hiring across multiple disciplines and welcome candidates at all levels of education and experience, providing comprehensive training. 
Leadership positions are available for those with proven skills. Our mission is guided by the values of endurance, passion, and aptitude.
