MTS (Member of Technical Staff), Superconducting Quantum Processor 

Job Summary:
To unleash the unprecedented power of quantum computing, we are pioneering the development of large-scale, high-quality superconducting processors based on fluxonium qubits. 
Over the past few years, our team has developed foundational technologies, including high-quality qubits with millisecond coherence times, efficient and robust qubit initialization, various high-fidelity two-qubit gates, and innovations in designing, manufacturing, and calibrating multi-qubit fluxonium processors.
To continue our mission at S Lab, we are seeking creative and result-driven researchers and engineers to build a multidisciplinary team. 
This team will cover superconducting device theory, superconducting quantum circuit design, cryogenic characterization of quantum devices, processor calibration, and hardware and software integration. 
All levels of experience are welcome. Candidates with proven leadership skills may be considered for a Team Lead position.

Qualification:
• An advanced degree or extensive working experience in the relevant technical fields: experimental or theoretical condensed matter physics, AMO physics, computational electromagnetism, electrical engineering, material science, cryogenic engineering, computer engineering. 
• Demonstration of strong track record of success in one the relevant technical fields.
