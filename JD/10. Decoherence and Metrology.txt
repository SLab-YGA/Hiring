MTS (Member of Technical Staff), Decoherence and Metrology

Job Summary:
Decoherence presents a primary challenge in advancing quantum computing with superconducting qubits. 
To extend the coherence times of qubits, it is essential to systematically characterize and quantify decoherence, and then identify its underlying physical mechanisms and develop its mitigation strategies. 
We are seeking knowledgeable scientists and engineers to join our multidisciplinary team and address the vital task of enhancing qubit coherence. 
Successful candidates will concentrate on researching the decoherence mechanisms of superconducting qubits in collaboration with our fabrication and theoretical teams. 
All levels of experience are welcome. 
Candidates with proven leadership skills may be considered for a Team Lead position.

Key Responsibilities:
• Perform cryogenic measurement and characterization of superconducting quantum devices
• Develop metrology devices and tools for decoherence
• Conduct pathfinding research on the decoherence mechanisms and their mitigation on superconducting quantum devices
• Contribute to the optimization of materials, fabrication processes, and cryogenic environments

Qualifications: 
• An advanced degree or a proven track record of strong performance in at least one of these fields: experimental condensed matter physics, applied physics, material science, and electrical engineering
• Proficiency in programming languages, notably Python or other scripting languages
• Experienced with experimental design and low-temperature characterization of nano-/mesoscopic scale or microwave devices
