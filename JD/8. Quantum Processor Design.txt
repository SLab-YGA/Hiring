MTS (Member of Technical Staff), Quantum Processor Design

Job Summary:
We are looking for expert scientists and engineers specialized in design and device modeling for superconducting quantum devices to become part of our multidisciplinary team. 
Successful candidates will design, simulate, and theoretically examine our next general of superconducting quantum processors. 
All levels of experience are welcome. 
Candidates with proven leadership skills may be considered for a Team Lead position.

Key Responsibilities: 
• Simulate the electromagnetic properties of superconducting quantum devices and packaging numerically
• Create layouts for superconducting quantum processors
• Innovate qubits, operational modes, and architectures for superconducting quantum processors
• Contribute to the corresponding EDA tool development

Qualifications:
• An advanced degree or a proven track record of strong performance in at least one of these fields: theoretical condensed matter physics, AMO physics, computational electromagnetism, electrical/microwave engineering
• Proficiency in programming languages, notably Python and C/C++
• Experienced in using design/simulation tools like Ansys HFSS, Sonnet, COMSOL, etc
• Familiarity with device layout scripting and automation is desirable
• Background in superconducting quantum device theory, including circuit quantization and circuitQED theory, is advantageous
