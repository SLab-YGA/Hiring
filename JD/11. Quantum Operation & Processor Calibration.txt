MTS (Member of Technical Staff), Quantum Operation & Processor Calibration

Job Summary:
We are seeking scientists and engineers to join our interdisciplinary team focused on calibrating superconducting quantum processors to achieve high fidelity operations. 
Superconducting quantum circuits, also known as artificial atoms, are human-designed and manufactured. 
This property offers tremendous opportunities for innovation in processor architecture and quantum operations. 
However, design and fabrication imperfections necessitate sophisticated calibration of circuit parameters and control signals. 
Ideal candidates will commit to exploring high-fidelity quantum operations and developing efficient calibration procedures suitable for large-scale quantum processors. 
All levels of experience are welcome. 
Candidates with proven leadership skills may be considered for a Team Lead position.

Key Responsibilities: 
• Set up the cryogenic testing environment, conduct characterizations and calibrations on quantum processors, and convert measured characteristics into actionable modifications in collaboration with other teams
• Integrate improvements in design, fabrication, and the hardware system into flagship processors
• Design and implement software suits for automating processor characterization and calibration
• Conduct pathfinding research aimed at improving operation fidelity and processor architecture
• (For Team Lead) Lead research projects and deliver timely impactful results
• (For Team Lead) Provide mentorship and guidance to foster the growth of junior colleagues within the team

Qualifications: 
• An advanced degree or a proven track record of strong performance in at least one of these fields: quantum physics, experimental condensed matter physics, electronic engineering, and computer science
• Proficiency in programming languages, notably Python or other scripting languages
• Experienced in mathematical modeling and error function construction for optimization problems
• Strong problem-solving skills and ability to work independently
• Background in superconducting quantum computing is advantageous
