MTS (Member of Technical Staff), Algorithms & Applications Team, Software Engineer

Job Summary:
We are an interdisciplinary, specialized, and international team dedicated to long-term exploratory research aimed at realizing the potential of quantum computing. 
Our current primary objective is to develop superconducting quantum processors that meet international advanced standards.
We are currently recruiting talent for the visualization and management of quantum system software. 
We welcome candidates of all experience levels.

Key Responsibilities:
• Design, develop, and maintain visualization management features, including task scheduling for quantum computing, parameter configuration, command operations, real-time status monitoring, data analysis, log tracking, and alert systems
• Develop high-quality code, completing functional development, automated testing, code documentation, development documentation, and user manuals
• Optimize software implementation logic to continuously improve operational efficiency
• Conduct preliminary research, technology selection, and prototype experiments based on project requirements, providing feasible solutions and recommendations
• Collaborate with other development and research teams to complete additional tasks required for the project

Qualifications:
• Master's degree or above from a regular full-time program in computer science, mathematics, physics, electronic engineering, automation, or related fields. Candidates with a background in quantum computing are preferred. Graduates from top universities (985, 211, or equivalent overseas institutions) are given priority
• Minimum of 5 years of work experience, with the ability to write efficient, standardized, and maintainable code. Familiarity with software engineering development processes and Git code management
• Proficiency in fundamental data structures and understanding of operating system concepts such as processes, threads, mutexes, and semaphores. Familiarity with the TCP/IP protocol stack and experience with distributed computing and concurrency practices are preferred
• Expertise in Python, Django, and Vue frameworks, with proficiency in at least one additional programming language such as JavaScript, C, or C++
• Experience with database operations and SQL syntax, with practical project experience in MySQL or PostgreSQL
• Good command of English, capable of reading related technical documents and papers, and writing design documents and emails in English
• Self-driven, capable of working independently, and possessing strong team collaboration and communication skills
• Preferred experience in one of the following areas:
(1) Participated in the development and delivery of similar systems, familiar with the overall system framework, backend service design, and frontend display technologies
(2) Contributed to open-source quantum computing libraries (e.g., Qiskit, OpenQASM), with knowledge of quantum algorithms, quantum compilers, and quantum simulators
(3) Experience in developing drivers or services for devices such as waveform digitizers and arbitrary waveform generators
