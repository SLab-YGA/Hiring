# Hiring
# MTS (Member of Technical Staff), Algorithms & Applications Team, Quantum-Leaped Computing (QLC)

Job Summary:
We envision the first practical use of quantum computing through what we call "Quantum-Leaped Computing (QLC)," a heterogeneous system integrating CPUs, GPUs, and Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). 
We are building a team of creative and result-driven algorithmic engineers for the design, implementation, evaluation, and optimization of classical-quantum hybrid algorithms for our QLC systems. 
All levels of experience are welcome. Candidates with proven leadership skills may be considered for a Team Lead position.

Key Responsibilities:
• (For Team Lead) Build and lead a team of algorithmic engineers with expertise in AI, quantum, and classical-quantum algorithms.
• Develop, implement, evaluate, and optimize classical-quantum AI algorithms.
• Collaborate with both external and internal experts on algorithms, domain applications, and system architecture.
• Document all project developments and maintain high-quality software repositories.
• Stay at the forefront of innovations in AI, quantum computing, and classical-quantum hybrid algorithms.
• (For Team Lead) Provide mentorship and guidance to foster the growth of junior colleagues within the team.

Qualifications:
• (For Team Lead) A doctoral degree (PhD) in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Mathematics, Theoretical Physics, or a closely related discipline with a strong record in quantum or classical-quantum algorithms.
• Proficiency in understanding and working with AI algorithms.
• Expertise in programming languages such as Python, C++, or Java.
• Experience with utilizing hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) specifically for deep learning applications.
• Familiarity with the principles of quantum computing and related technologies is a plus.
• Proven track record in developing and fine-tuning algorithms designed for processing large-scale datasets.
